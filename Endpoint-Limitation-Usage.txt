1) Endpoint Of Solution: - 
A)"Home/Index" to acces the controller method and getting result for the output required.

2) web-based usage of your API : - There are 3 teatboxes in the api where in user has to pass number of series(quantity of numbers),
divisor, and the Nth Number.
If all of them are being passed then hitting the submit button will result into giving the number nth number divisible by divisor on the dynamic series
Also it shows and prints the series.

3) Limitations:-

A) Api will not give print correct number after 37 number in the series.
B)If the Nth Number divisible by Divisor not exist in the dynamic series it will show zero as result.
